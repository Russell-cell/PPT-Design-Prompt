# PPT-image Design System Inspired by Notion

This file adapts the original web/UI-focused design system into a presentation-image system for slides.
Use it to generate cover art, chapter dividers, concept visuals, comparison plates, system diagrams, data backdrops, and closing posters that still feel unmistakably Notion.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

This PPT-image adaptation keeps Notion's brand DNA intact, but compresses it into slide-ready visuals instead of webpage UI.
The first priority is to preserve the original atmosphere: Notion's website embodies the philosophy of the tool itself: a blank canvas that gets out of your way.
The second priority is to make every image behave like a presentation asset: one slide thesis, one dominant focal point, and enough calm space for editable overlay text.

### Original Brand DNA

Notion's website embodies the philosophy of the tool itself: a blank canvas that gets out of your way. The design system is built on warm neutrals rather than cold grays, creating a distinctly approachable minimalism that feels like quality paper rather than sterile glass. The page canvas is pure white (`#ffffff`) but the text isn't pure black -- it's a warm near-black (`rgba(0,0,0,0.95)`) that softens the reading experience imperceptibly. The warm gray scale (`#f6f5f4`, `#31302e`, `#615d59`, `#a39e98`) carries subtle yellow-brown undertones, giving the interface a tactile, almost analog warmth.

The custom NotionInter font (a modified Inter) is the backbone of the system. At display sizes (64px), it uses aggressive negative letter-spacing (-2.125px), creating headlines that feel compressed and precise. The weight range is broader than typical systems: 400 for body, 500 for UI elements, 600 for semi-bold labels, and 700 for display headings. OpenType features `"lnum"` (lining numerals) and `"locl"` (localized forms) are enabled on larger text, adding typographic sophistication that rewards close reading.

What makes Notion's visual language distinctive is its border philosophy. Rather than heavy borders or shadows, Notion uses ultra-thin `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` borders -- borders that exist as whispers, barely perceptible division lines that create structure without weight. The shadow system is equally restrained: multi-layer stacks with cumulative opacity never exceeding 0.05, creating depth that's felt rather than seen.

**Key Characteristics:**
- NotionInter (modified Inter) with negative letter-spacing at display sizes (-2.125px at 64px)
- Warm neutral palette: grays carry yellow-brown undertones (`#f6f5f4` warm white, `#31302e` warm dark)
- Near-black text via `rgba(0,0,0,0.95)` -- not pure black, creating micro-warmth
- Ultra-thin borders: `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` throughout -- whisper-weight division
- Multi-layer shadow stacks with sub-0.05 opacity for barely-there depth
- Notion Blue (`#0075de`) as the singular accent color for CTAs and interactive elements
- Pill badges (9999px radius) with tinted blue backgrounds for status indicators
- 8px base spacing unit with an organic, non-rigid scale


### PPT-image Translation

- Treat every image as a slide asset, not a webpage screenshot.
- Preserve the brand's strongest cues: NotionInter (modified Inter) with negative letter-spacing at display sizes (-2.125px at 64px), Warm neutral palette: grays carry yellow-brown undertones (#f6f5f4 warm white, #31302e warm dark), Near-black text via rgba(0,0,0,0.95) -- not pure black, creating micro-warmth, and Ultra-thin borders: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1) throughout -- whisper-weight division.
- Use Notion Blue (#0075de) as the highest-signal accent when color needs to carry emphasis.
- Let Pure White (#ffffff) carry calmer title-safe zones and quieter data-support slides.
- Use Deep Navy (#213183) for cinematic divider slides, closing posters, or contrast-heavy cover moments.
- Keep 25% to 35% of the frame visibly calmer than the hero area so the slide layer can hold live text.
- When in doubt, choose one dominant subject, one support layer, and one background atmosphere layer instead of recreating dense UI layouts.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Original Brand Palette

### Primary
- **Notion Black** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.95)` / `#000000f2`): Primary text, headings, body copy. The 95% opacity softens pure black without sacrificing readability.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Page background, card surfaces, button text on blue.
- **Notion Blue** (`#0075de`): Primary CTA, link color, interactive accent -- the only saturated color in the core UI chrome.

### Brand Secondary
- **Deep Navy** (`#213183`): Secondary brand color, used sparingly for emphasis and dark feature sections.
- **Active Blue** (`#005bab`): Button active/pressed state -- darker variant of Notion Blue.

### Warm Neutral Scale
- **Warm White** (`#f6f5f4`): Background surface tint, section alternation, subtle card fill. The yellow undertone is key.
- **Warm Dark** (`#31302e`): Dark surface background, dark section text. Warmer than standard grays.
- **Warm Gray 500** (`#615d59`): Secondary text, descriptions, muted labels.
- **Warm Gray 300** (`#a39e98`): Placeholder text, disabled states, caption text.

### Semantic Accent Colors
- **Teal** (`#2a9d99`): Success states, positive indicators.
- **Green** (`#1aae39`): Confirmation, completion badges.
- **Orange** (`#dd5b00`): Warning states, attention indicators.
- **Pink** (`#ff64c8`): Decorative accent, feature highlights.
- **Purple** (`#391c57`): Premium features, deep accents.
- **Brown** (`#523410`): Earthy accent, warm feature sections.

### Interactive
- **Link Blue** (`#0075de`): Primary link color with underline-on-hover.
- **Link Light Blue** (`#62aef0`): Lighter link variant for dark backgrounds.
- **Focus Blue** (`#097fe8`): Focus ring on interactive elements.
- **Badge Blue Bg** (`#f2f9ff`): Pill badge background, tinted blue surface.
- **Badge Blue Text** (`#097fe8`): Pill badge text, darker blue for readability.

### Shadows & Depth
- **Card Shadow** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 4px 18px, rgba(0,0,0,0.027) 0px 2.025px 7.84688px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 0.8px 2.925px, rgba(0,0,0,0.01) 0px 0.175px 1.04062px`): Multi-layer card elevation.
- **Deep Shadow** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.01) 0px 1px 3px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 3px 7px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 7px 15px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 14px 28px, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 23px 52px`): Five-layer deep elevation for modals and featured content.
- **Whisper Border** (`1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`): Standard division border -- cards, dividers, sections.


### PPT-image Deployment

- Base canvas: prefer Pure White (#ffffff) when the deck needs editorial calm or readable overlay copy.
- Bold contrast canvas: prefer Deep Navy (#213183) when the deck needs cinematic weight or a chapter reset.
- Primary accent: Notion Blue (#0075de) should carry the strongest callout, hero focal area, or high-signal data accent.
- Chart and callout rule: stay inside the original palette above; do not import generic presentation blues or purples if they are not already part of the brand.
- Safe-zone rule: overlay areas should be one contrast step quieter than the hero area.
- Series rule: the same accent/surface hierarchy should repeat across cover, divider, body images, and closing slides so the deck reads as one system.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Original Brand Typography

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `NotionInter`, with fallbacks: `Inter, -apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Helvetica, Apple Color Emoji, Arial, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol`
- **OpenType Features**: `"lnum"` (lining numerals) and `"locl"` (localized forms) enabled on display and heading text.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display Hero | NotionInter | 64px (4.00rem) | 700 | 1.00 (tight) | -2.125px | Maximum compression, billboard headlines |
| Display Secondary | NotionInter | 54px (3.38rem) | 700 | 1.04 (tight) | -1.875px | Secondary hero, feature headlines |
| Section Heading | NotionInter | 48px (3.00rem) | 700 | 1.00 (tight) | -1.5px | Feature section titles, with `"lnum"` |
| Sub-heading Large | NotionInter | 40px (2.50rem) | 700 | 1.50 | normal | Card headings, feature sub-sections |
| Sub-heading | NotionInter | 26px (1.63rem) | 700 | 1.23 (tight) | -0.625px | Section sub-titles, content headers |
| Card Title | NotionInter | 22px (1.38rem) | 700 | 1.27 (tight) | -0.25px | Feature cards, list titles |
| Body Large | NotionInter | 20px (1.25rem) | 600 | 1.40 | -0.125px | Introductions, feature descriptions |
| Body | NotionInter | 16px (1.00rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Standard reading text |
| Body Medium | NotionInter | 16px (1.00rem) | 500 | 1.50 | normal | Navigation, emphasized UI text |
| Body Semibold | NotionInter | 16px (1.00rem) | 600 | 1.50 | normal | Strong labels, active states |
| Body Bold | NotionInter | 16px (1.00rem) | 700 | 1.50 | normal | Headlines at body size |
| Nav / Button | NotionInter | 15px (0.94rem) | 600 | 1.33 | normal | Navigation links, button text |
| Caption | NotionInter | 14px (0.88rem) | 500 | 1.43 | normal | Metadata, secondary labels |
| Caption Light | NotionInter | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 1.43 | normal | Body captions, descriptions |
| Badge | NotionInter | 12px (0.75rem) | 600 | 1.33 | 0.125px | Pill badges, tags, status labels |
| Micro Label | NotionInter | 12px (0.75rem) | 400 | 1.33 | 0.125px | Small metadata, timestamps |

### Principles
- **Compression at scale**: NotionInter at display sizes uses -2.125px letter-spacing at 64px, progressively relaxing to -0.625px at 26px and normal at 16px. The compression creates density at headlines while maintaining readability at body sizes.
- **Four-weight system**: 400 (body/reading), 500 (UI/interactive), 600 (emphasis/navigation), 700 (headings/display). The broader weight range compared to most systems allows nuanced hierarchy.
- **Warm scaling**: Line height tightens as size increases -- 1.50 at body (16px), 1.23-1.27 at sub-headings, 1.00-1.04 at display. This creates denser, more impactful headlines.
- **Badge micro-tracking**: The 12px badge text uses positive letter-spacing (0.125px) -- the only positive tracking in the system, creating wider, more legible small text.


### PPT-image Type Deployment

- Use `NotionInter, with fallbacks: Inter, -apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Helvetica, Apple Color Emoji, Arial, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol` as the reference voice for cover words, chapter titles, or one-line in-image headlines when baked text is necessary.
- Use `"lnum" (lining numerals) and "locl" (localized forms) enabled on display and heading text.` for labels, short annotations, numerals, or tiny UI-like callouts inside the art.
- Do not bake full slide titles, speaker notes, or body paragraphs into generated images.
- Favor one hero word, one short divider title, one oversized number, or 1 to 3 diagram labels that can survive projection.
- Preserve the original brand's weight, tracking, and casing personality instead of flattening everything into generic presentation typography.

### PPT-image Asset Translation

#### Cover / Opening Hero

- Use Notion's strongest visual cues as one large, unmistakable scene or object.
- Let Notion Blue (#0075de), Pure White (#ffffff), and Deep Navy (#213183) establish the hierarchy before adding any text.
- Pull attitude from Buttons, Cards & Containers, Inputs & Forms, and Navigation rather than recreating literal buttons, nav bars, or forms.
- Keep the cover readable in thumbnail view and leave one obvious title-safe zone.

#### Section Divider

- Simplify the composition relative to the cover.
- Keep the brand mood intact, but reduce detail density so the divider feels like a chapter reset rather than a second homepage hero.
- Reuse the same material and depth language instead of inventing a new visual style mid-deck.

#### Concept Visualization

- Translate abstract ideas into one visual metaphor that still feels native to Notion.
- Borrow the brand's surface language, shape logic, and spacing restraint from the original system above.
- Avoid icon soup, dashboard screenshots, or five competing metaphors in one frame.

#### Comparison Plate

- When the slide is about contrast, use split composition, confrontation, or mirrored structure without abandoning the brand system.
- Let the palette do part of the comparison work: Pure White (#ffffff) versus Deep Navy (#213183), with Notion Blue (#0075de) reserved for the decisive signal.
- Keep both sides visually disciplined so the comparison reads at a glance.

#### Data Backdrop

- Data-support images should be calmer than cover or divider art.
- Use the brand's layout and spacing DNA (Spacing System, Grid & Container, and Whitespace Philosophy) to create clean fields for charts, numerals, or callouts.
- Avoid hero subjects that fight the actual data layer.

#### System / Workflow Plate

- Convert the original component logic into presentation diagrams, route maps, or structural visuals rather than literal product UI.
- Keep the image designed, not tool-generated: large shapes, few node types, deliberate connectors, and brand-consistent type.
- Depth should follow Decorative Depth instead of generic infographic shadows.

#### Closing Poster

- Compress the deck's final judgment into one memorable frame.
- Use the same brand surfaces and accent hierarchy, but simplify harder than the cover.
- The closing image should resolve the story, not reopen complexity.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Original Layout DNA

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 2px, 3px, 4px, 5px, 6px, 7px, 8px, 11px, 12px, 14px, 16px, 24px, 32px
- Non-rigid organic scale with fractional values (5.6px, 6.4px) for micro-adjustments

### Grid & Container
- Max content width: approximately 1200px
- Hero: centered single-column with generous top padding (80-120px)
- Feature sections: 2-3 column grids for cards
- Full-width warm white (`#f6f5f4`) section backgrounds for alternation
- Code/dashboard screenshots as contained with whisper border

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Generous vertical rhythm**: 64-120px between major sections. Notion lets content breathe with vast vertical padding.
- **Warm alternation**: White sections alternate with warm white (`#f6f5f4`) sections, creating gentle visual rhythm without harsh color breaks.
- **Content-first density**: Body text blocks are compact (line-height 1.50) but surrounded by ample margin, creating islands of readable content in a sea of white space.

### Border Radius Scale
- Micro (4px): Buttons, inputs, functional interactive elements
- Subtle (5px): Links, list items, menu items
- Standard (8px): Small cards, containers, inline elements
- Comfortable (12px): Standard cards, feature containers, image tops
- Large (16px): Hero cards, featured content, promotional blocks
- Full Pill (9999px): Badges, pills, status indicators
- Circle (100%): Tab indicators, avatars


### PPT-image Layout Translation

- Default output: `16:9` horizontal, ideally `3840x2160`.
- Keep meaning-critical content inside the central 80% width and height so mild crop or projector overscan does not break the slide.
- Translate the brand's spacing philosophy above into image composition rather than scroll rhythm.
- Reuse the original radius/edge discipline inside objects, cards, frames, or image masks.
- Let asymmetry create cleaner title-safe zones when possible; use symmetry only when the concept itself is ceremonial, confrontational, or product-showroom centered.

## 6. Depth & Elevation

### Original Depth System

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, no border | Page background, text blocks |
| Whisper (Level 1) | `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` | Standard borders, card outlines, dividers |
| Soft Card (Level 2) | 4-layer shadow stack (max opacity 0.04) | Content cards, feature blocks |
| Deep Card (Level 3) | 5-layer shadow stack (max opacity 0.05, 52px blur) | Modals, featured panels, hero elements |
| Focus (Accessibility) | `2px solid var(--focus-color)` outline | Keyboard focus on all interactive elements |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Notion's shadow system uses multiple layers with extremely low individual opacity (0.01 to 0.05) that accumulate into soft, natural-looking elevation. The 4-layer card shadow spans from 1.04px to 18px blur, creating a gradient of depth rather than a single hard shadow. The 5-layer deep shadow extends to 52px blur at 0.05 opacity, producing ambient occlusion that feels like natural light rather than computer-generated depth. This layered approach makes elements feel embedded in the page rather than floating above it.

### Decorative Depth
- Hero section: decorative character illustrations (playful, hand-drawn style)
- Section alternation: white to warm white (`#f6f5f4`) background shifts
- No hard section borders -- separation comes from background color changes and spacing


### PPT-image Depth Translation

- Use the same elevation language above in image form: hero subject, support plane, background atmosphere.
- Preserve the brand's native depth behavior instead of defaulting to generic 3D gloss or floating glass panels.
- If the original system is flat, keep slide art flatter and more graphic.
- If the original system uses rings, glow, or border-defined depth, let those cues appear in the image edges, frames, and callout objects.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Original Guardrails

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile Small | <400px | Tight single column, minimal padding |
| Mobile | 400-600px | Standard mobile, stacked layout |
| Tablet Small | 600-768px | 2-column grids begin |
| Tablet | 768-1080px | Full card grids, expanded padding |
| Desktop Small | 1080-1200px | Standard desktop layout |
| Desktop | 1200-1440px | Full layout, maximum content width |
| Large Desktop | >1440px | Centered, generous margins |

### Touch Targets
- Buttons use comfortable padding (8px-16px vertical)
- Navigation links at 15px with adequate spacing
- Pill badges have 8px horizontal padding for tap targets
- Mobile menu toggle uses standard hamburger button

### Collapsing Strategy
- Hero: 64px display -> scales to 40px -> 26px on mobile, maintains proportional letter-spacing
- Navigation: horizontal links + blue CTA -> hamburger menu
- Feature cards: 3-column -> 2-column -> single column stacked
- Product screenshots: maintain aspect ratio with responsive images
- Trust bar logos: grid -> horizontal scroll on mobile
- Footer: multi-column -> stacked single column
- Section spacing: 80px+ -> 48px on mobile

### Image Behavior
- Workspace screenshots maintain whisper border at all sizes
- Hero illustrations scale proportionally
- Product screenshots use responsive images with consistent border radius
- Full-width warm white sections maintain edge-to-edge treatment


### PPT-image Guardrails

- Do preserve the original mood before adding presentation convenience.
- Do generate from the slide thesis, not from the overall deck topic alone.
- Do leave room for editable slide text instead of baking everything into the image.
- Do keep one dominant idea per frame.
- Don't turn every slide into a homepage hero.
- Don't import off-brand gradients, stock photography tropes, or default AI wallpaper aesthetics.
- Don't bake unreadable microtext, fake dashboards, or dense UI chrome into supporting images unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Original UI Responsiveness

### Focus System
- All interactive elements receive visible focus indicators
- Focus outline: `2px solid` with focus color + shadow level 200
- Tab navigation supported throughout all interactive components
- High contrast text: near-black on white exceeds WCAG AAA (>14:1 ratio)

### Interactive States
- **Default**: Standard appearance with whisper borders
- **Hover**: Color shift on text, scale(1.05) on buttons, underline on links
- **Active/Pressed**: scale(0.9) transform, darker background variant
- **Focus**: Blue outline ring with shadow reinforcement
- **Disabled**: Warm gray (`#a39e98`) text, reduced opacity

### Color Contrast
- Primary text (rgba(0,0,0,0.95)) on white: ~18:1 ratio
- Secondary text (#615d59) on white: ~5.5:1 ratio (WCAG AA)
- Blue CTA (#0075de) on white: ~4.6:1 ratio (WCAG AA for large text)
- Badge text (#097fe8) on badge bg (#f2f9ff): ~4.5:1 ratio (WCAG AA for large text)


### PPT-image Crop & Export Behavior

- Treat responsiveness as crop resilience, PDF export resilience, and projector readability.
- Generate the master in `16:9`, but keep essential meaning safe under a mild crop to `4:3`.
- Prepare left-safe, right-safe, or center-safe variants when the final slide layout is not locked.
- Avoid placing critical labels, faces, or symbols near the outer 8% margins.
- If a deck will carry heavy overlay copy, request a calmer variant with more negative space.

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Original UI Prompt Reference

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary CTA: Notion Blue (`#0075de`)
- Background: Pure White (`#ffffff`)
- Alt Background: Warm White (`#f6f5f4`)
- Heading text: Near-Black (`rgba(0,0,0,0.95)`)
- Body text: Near-Black (`rgba(0,0,0,0.95)`)
- Secondary text: Warm Gray 500 (`#615d59`)

- Border: `1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`
- Link: Notion Blue (`#0075de`)
- Focus ring: Focus Blue (`#097fe8`)

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a hero section on white background. Headline at 64px NotionInter weight 700, line-height 1.00, letter-spacing -2.125px, color rgba(0,0,0,0.95). Subtitle at 20px weight 600, line-height 1.40, color #615d59. Blue CTA button (#0075de, 4px radius, 8px 16px padding, white text) and ghost button (transparent bg, near-black text, underline on hover)."
- "Design a card: white background, 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1) border, 12px radius. Use shadow stack: rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 4px 18px, rgba(0,0,0,0.027) 0px 2.025px 7.85px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 0.8px 2.93px, rgba(0,0,0,0.01) 0px 0.175px 1.04px. Title at 22px NotionInter weight 700, letter-spacing -0.25px. Body at 16px weight 400, color #615d59."
- "Build a pill badge: #f2f9ff background, #097fe8 text, 9999px radius, 4px 8px padding, 12px NotionInter weight 600, letter-spacing 0.125px."
- "Create navigation: white header. NotionInter 15px weight 600 for links, near-black text. Blue pill CTA 'Get Notion free' right-aligned (#0075de bg, white text, 4px radius)."
- "Design an alternating section layout: white sections alternate with warm white (#f6f5f4) sections. Each section has 64-80px vertical padding, max-width 1200px centered. Section heading at 48px weight 700, line-height 1.00, letter-spacing -1.5px."

### Iteration Guide
1. Always use warm neutrals -- Notion's grays have yellow-brown undertones (#f6f5f4, #31302e, #615d59, #a39e98), never blue-gray
2. Letter-spacing scales with font size: -2.125px at 64px, -1.875px at 54px, -0.625px at 26px, normal at 16px
3. Four weights: 400 (read), 500 (interact), 600 (emphasize), 700 (announce)
4. Borders are whispers: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1) -- never heavier
