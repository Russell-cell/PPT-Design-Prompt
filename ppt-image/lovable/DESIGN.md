# PPT-image Design System Inspired by Lovable

This file adapts the original web/UI-focused design system into a presentation-image system for slides.
Use it to generate cover art, chapter dividers, concept visuals, comparison plates, system diagrams, data backdrops, and closing posters that still feel unmistakably Lovable.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

This PPT-image adaptation keeps Lovable's brand DNA intact, but compresses it into slide-ready visuals instead of webpage UI.
The first priority is to preserve the original atmosphere: Lovable's website radiates warmth through restraint.
The second priority is to make every image behave like a presentation asset: one slide thesis, one dominant focal point, and enough calm space for editable overlay text.

### Original Brand DNA

Lovable's website radiates warmth through restraint. The entire page sits on a creamy, parchment-toned background (`#f7f4ed`) that immediately separates it from the cold-white conventions of most developer tool sites. This isn't minimalism for minimalism's sake — it's a deliberate choice to feel approachable, almost analog, like a well-crafted notebook. The near-black text (`#1c1c1c`) against this warm cream creates a contrast ratio that's easy on the eyes while maintaining sharp readability.

The custom Camera Plain Variable typeface is the system's secret weapon. Unlike geometric sans-serifs that signal "tech company," Camera Plain has a humanist warmth — slightly rounded terminals, organic curves, and a comfortable reading rhythm. At display sizes (48px–60px), weight 600 with aggressive negative letter-spacing (-0.9px to -1.5px) compresses headlines into confident, editorial statements. The font uses `ui-sans-serif, system-ui` as fallbacks, acknowledging that the custom typeface carries the brand personality.

What makes Lovable's visual system distinctive is its opacity-driven depth model. Rather than using a traditional gray scale, the system modulates `#1c1c1c` at varying opacities (0.03, 0.04, 0.4, 0.82–0.83) to create a unified tonal range. Every shade of gray on the page is technically the same hue — just more or less transparent. This creates a visual coherence that's nearly impossible to achieve with arbitrary hex values. The border system follows suit: `1px solid #eceae4` for light divisions and `1px solid rgba(28, 28, 28, 0.4)` for stronger interactive boundaries.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Warm parchment background (`#f7f4ed`) — not white, not beige, a deliberate cream that feels hand-selected
- Camera Plain Variable typeface with humanist warmth and editorial letter-spacing at display sizes
- Opacity-driven color system: all grays derived from `#1c1c1c` at varying transparency levels
- Inset shadow technique on buttons: `rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 0px 0.5px 0px 0px inset, rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset`
- Warm neutral border palette: `#eceae4` for subtle, `rgba(28,28,28,0.4)` for interactive elements
- Full-pill radius (`9999px`) used extensively for action buttons and icon containers
- Focus state uses `rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 4px 12px` shadow for soft, warm emphasis
- shadcn/ui + Radix UI component primitives with Tailwind CSS utility styling


### PPT-image Translation

- Treat every image as a slide asset, not a webpage screenshot.
- Preserve the brand's strongest cues: Warm parchment background (#f7f4ed) — not white, not beige, a deliberate cream that feels hand-selected, Camera Plain Variable typeface with humanist warmth and editorial letter-spacing at display sizes, Opacity-driven color system: all grays derived from #1c1c1c at varying transparency levels, and Inset shadow technique on buttons: rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 0px 0.5px 0px 0px inset, rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset.
- Use Charcoal (#1c1c1c) as the highest-signal accent when color needs to carry emphasis.
- Let Cream (#f7f4ed) carry calmer title-safe zones and quieter data-support slides.
- Use Charcoal (#1c1c1c) for cinematic divider slides, closing posters, or contrast-heavy cover moments.
- Keep 25% to 35% of the frame visibly calmer than the hero area so the slide layer can hold live text.
- When in doubt, choose one dominant subject, one support layer, and one background atmosphere layer instead of recreating dense UI layouts.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Original Brand Palette

### Primary
- **Cream** (`#f7f4ed`): Page background, card surfaces, button surfaces. The foundation — warm, paper-like, human.
- **Charcoal** (`#1c1c1c`): Primary text, headings, dark button backgrounds. Not pure black — organic warmth.
- **Off-White** (`#fcfbf8`): Button text on dark backgrounds, subtle highlight. Barely distinguishable from pure white.

### Neutral Scale (Opacity-Based)
- **Charcoal 100%** (`#1c1c1c`): Primary text, headings, dark surfaces.
- **Charcoal 83%** (`rgba(28,28,28,0.83)`): Strong secondary text.
- **Charcoal 82%** (`rgba(28,28,28,0.82)`): Body copy.
- **Muted Gray** (`#5f5f5d`): Secondary text, descriptions, captions.
- **Charcoal 40%** (`rgba(28,28,28,0.4)`): Interactive borders, button outlines.
- **Charcoal 4%** (`rgba(28,28,28,0.04)`): Subtle hover backgrounds, micro-tints.
- **Charcoal 3%** (`rgba(28,28,28,0.03)`): Barely-visible overlays, background depth.

### Surface & Border
- **Light Cream** (`#eceae4`): Card borders, dividers, image outlines. The warm divider line.
- **Cream Surface** (`#f7f4ed`): Card backgrounds, section fills — same as page background for seamless integration.

### Interactive
- **Ring Blue** (`#3b82f6` at 50% opacity): `--tw-ring-color`, Tailwind focus ring.
- **Focus Shadow** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 4px 12px`): Focus and active state shadow — soft, warm, diffused.

### Inset Shadows
- **Button Inset** (`rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 0px 0.5px 0px 0px inset, rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 1px 2px 0px`): The signature multi-layer inset shadow on dark buttons.


### PPT-image Deployment

- Base canvas: prefer Cream (#f7f4ed) when the deck needs editorial calm or readable overlay copy.
- Bold contrast canvas: prefer Charcoal (#1c1c1c) when the deck needs cinematic weight or a chapter reset.
- Primary accent: Charcoal (#1c1c1c) should carry the strongest callout, hero focal area, or high-signal data accent.
- Chart and callout rule: stay inside the original palette above; do not import generic presentation blues or purples if they are not already part of the brand.
- Safe-zone rule: overlay areas should be one contrast step quieter than the hero area.
- Series rule: the same accent/surface hierarchy should repeat across cover, divider, body images, and closing slides so the deck reads as one system.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Original Brand Typography

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `Camera Plain Variable`, with fallbacks: `ui-sans-serif, system-ui`
- **Weight range**: 400 (body/reading), 480 (special display), 600 (headings/emphasis)
- **Feature**: Variable font with continuous weight axis — allows fine-tuned intermediary weights like 480.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display Hero | Camera Plain Variable | 60px (3.75rem) | 600 | 1.00–1.10 (tight) | -1.5px | Maximum impact, editorial |
| Display Alt | Camera Plain Variable | 60px (3.75rem) | 480 | 1.00 (tight) | normal | Lighter hero variant |
| Section Heading | Camera Plain Variable | 48px (3.00rem) | 600 | 1.00 (tight) | -1.2px | Feature section titles |
| Sub-heading | Camera Plain Variable | 36px (2.25rem) | 600 | 1.10 (tight) | -0.9px | Sub-sections |
| Card Title | Camera Plain Variable | 20px (1.25rem) | 400 | 1.25 (tight) | normal | Card headings |
| Body Large | Camera Plain Variable | 18px (1.13rem) | 400 | 1.38 | normal | Introductions |
| Body | Camera Plain Variable | 16px (1.00rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Standard reading text |
| Button | Camera Plain Variable | 16px (1.00rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Button labels |
| Button Small | Camera Plain Variable | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Compact buttons |
| Link | Camera Plain Variable | 16px (1.00rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Underline decoration |
| Link Small | Camera Plain Variable | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Footer links |
| Caption | Camera Plain Variable | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Metadata, small text |

### Principles
- **Warm humanist voice**: Camera Plain Variable gives Lovable its approachable personality. The slightly rounded terminals and organic curves contrast with the sharp geometric sans-serifs used by most developer tools.
- **Variable weight as design tool**: The font supports continuous weight values (e.g., 480), enabling nuanced hierarchy beyond standard weight stops. Weight 480 at 60px creates a display style that feels lighter than semibold but stronger than regular.
- **Compression at scale**: Headlines use negative letter-spacing (-0.9px to -1.5px) for editorial impact. Body text stays at normal tracking for comfortable reading.
- **Two weights, clear roles**: 400 (body/UI/links/buttons) and 600 (headings/emphasis). The narrow weight range creates hierarchy through size and spacing, not weight variation.


### PPT-image Type Deployment

- Use `Camera Plain Variable, with fallbacks: ui-sans-serif, system-ui` as the reference voice for cover words, chapter titles, or one-line in-image headlines when baked text is necessary.
- Use `400 (body/reading), 480 (special display), 600 (headings/emphasis)` for labels, short annotations, numerals, or tiny UI-like callouts inside the art.
- Do not bake full slide titles, speaker notes, or body paragraphs into generated images.
- Favor one hero word, one short divider title, one oversized number, or 1 to 3 diagram labels that can survive projection.
- Preserve the original brand's weight, tracking, and casing personality instead of flattening everything into generic presentation typography.

### PPT-image Asset Translation

#### Cover / Opening Hero

- Use Lovable's strongest visual cues as one large, unmistakable scene or object.
- Let Charcoal (#1c1c1c), Cream (#f7f4ed), and Charcoal (#1c1c1c) establish the hierarchy before adding any text.
- Pull attitude from Buttons, Cards & Containers, Inputs & Forms, and Navigation rather than recreating literal buttons, nav bars, or forms.
- Keep the cover readable in thumbnail view and leave one obvious title-safe zone.

#### Section Divider

- Simplify the composition relative to the cover.
- Keep the brand mood intact, but reduce detail density so the divider feels like a chapter reset rather than a second homepage hero.
- Reuse the same material and depth language instead of inventing a new visual style mid-deck.

#### Concept Visualization

- Translate abstract ideas into one visual metaphor that still feels native to Lovable.
- Borrow the brand's surface language, shape logic, and spacing restraint from the original system above.
- Avoid icon soup, dashboard screenshots, or five competing metaphors in one frame.

#### Comparison Plate

- When the slide is about contrast, use split composition, confrontation, or mirrored structure without abandoning the brand system.
- Let the palette do part of the comparison work: Cream (#f7f4ed) versus Charcoal (#1c1c1c), with Charcoal (#1c1c1c) reserved for the decisive signal.
- Keep both sides visually disciplined so the comparison reads at a glance.

#### Data Backdrop

- Data-support images should be calmer than cover or divider art.
- Use the brand's layout and spacing DNA (Spacing System, Grid & Container, and Whitespace Philosophy) to create clean fields for charts, numerals, or callouts.
- Avoid hero subjects that fight the actual data layer.

#### System / Workflow Plate

- Convert the original component logic into presentation diagrams, route maps, or structural visuals rather than literal product UI.
- Keep the image designed, not tool-generated: large shapes, few node types, deliberate connectors, and brand-consistent type.
- Depth should follow Decorative Depth instead of generic infographic shadows.

#### Closing Poster

- Compress the deck's final judgment into one memorable frame.
- Use the same brand surfaces and accent hierarchy, but simplify harder than the cover.
- The closing image should resolve the story, not reopen complexity.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Original Layout DNA

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 8px, 10px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 56px, 80px, 96px, 128px, 176px, 192px, 208px
- The scale expands generously at the top end — sections use 80px–208px vertical spacing for editorial breathing room

### Grid & Container
- Max content width: approximately 1200px (centered)
- Hero: centered single-column with massive vertical padding (96px+)
- Feature sections: 2–3 column grids
- Full-width footer with multi-column link layout
- Showcase sections with centered card grids

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Editorial generosity**: Lovable's spacing is lavish at section boundaries (80px–208px). The warm cream background makes these expanses feel cozy rather than empty.
- **Content-driven rhythm**: Tight internal spacing within cards (12–24px) contrasts with wide section gaps, creating a reading rhythm that alternates between focused content and visual rest.
- **Section separation**: Footer uses `1px solid #eceae4` border and 16px radius container. Sections defined by generous spacing rather than border lines.

### Border Radius Scale
- Micro (4px): Small buttons, interactive elements
- Standard (6px): Buttons, inputs, navigation menu
- Comfortable (8px): Compact cards, divs
- Card (12px): Standard cards, image containers, templates
- Container (16px): Large containers, footer sections
- Full Pill (9999px): Action pills, icon buttons, toggles


### PPT-image Layout Translation

- Default output: `16:9` horizontal, ideally `3840x2160`.
- Keep meaning-critical content inside the central 80% width and height so mild crop or projector overscan does not break the slide.
- Translate the brand's spacing philosophy above into image composition rather than scroll rhythm.
- Reuse the original radius/edge discipline inside objects, cards, frames, or image masks.
- Let asymmetry create cleaner title-safe zones when possible; use symmetry only when the concept itself is ceremonial, confrontational, or product-showroom centered.

## 6. Depth & Elevation

### Original Depth System

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, cream background | Page surface, most content |
| Bordered (Level 1) | `1px solid #eceae4` | Cards, images, dividers |
| Inset (Level 2) | `rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 0px 0.5px 0px inset, rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 1px 2px` | Dark buttons, primary actions |
| Focus (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 4px 12px` | Active/focus states |
| Ring (Accessibility) | `rgba(59,130,246,0.5)` 2px ring | Keyboard focus on inputs |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Lovable's depth system is intentionally shallow. Instead of floating cards with dramatic drop-shadows, the system relies on warm borders (`#eceae4`) against the cream surface to create gentle containment. The only notable shadow pattern is the inset shadow on dark buttons — a subtle multi-layer technique where a white highlight line sits at the top edge while a dark ring and soft drop handle the bottom. This creates a tactile, pressed-into-surface feeling rather than a hovering-above-surface feeling. The warm focus shadow (`rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 4px 12px`) is deliberately diffused and large, creating a soft glow rather than a sharp outline.

### Decorative Depth
- Hero: soft, warm multi-color gradient wash (pinks, oranges, blues) behind hero — atmospheric, barely visible
- Footer: gradient background with warm tones transitioning to the bottom
- No harsh section dividers — spacing and background warmth handle transitions


### PPT-image Depth Translation

- Use the same elevation language above in image form: hero subject, support plane, background atmosphere.
- Preserve the brand's native depth behavior instead of defaulting to generic 3D gloss or floating glass panels.
- If the original system is flat, keep slide art flatter and more graphic.
- If the original system uses rings, glow, or border-defined depth, let those cues appear in the image edges, frames, and callout objects.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Original Guardrails

### Do
- Use the warm cream background (`#f7f4ed`) as the page foundation — it's the brand's signature warmth
- Use Camera Plain Variable at display sizes with negative letter-spacing (-0.9px to -1.5px)
- Derive all grays from `#1c1c1c` at varying opacity levels for tonal unity
- Use the inset shadow technique on dark buttons for tactile depth
- Use `#eceae4` borders instead of shadows for card containment
- Keep the weight system narrow: 400 for body/UI, 600 for headings
- Use full-pill radius (9999px) only for action pills and icon buttons
- Apply opacity 0.8 on active states for responsive tactile feedback

### Don't
- Don't use pure white (`#ffffff`) as a page background — the cream is intentional
- Don't use heavy box-shadows for cards — borders are the containment mechanism
- Don't introduce saturated accent colors — the palette is intentionally warm-neutral
- Don't use weight 700 (bold) — 600 is the maximum weight in the system
- Don't apply 9999px radius on rectangular buttons — pills are for icon/action toggles
- Don't use sharp focus outlines — the system uses soft shadow-based focus indicators
- Don't mix border styles — `#eceae4` for passive, `rgba(28,28,28,0.4)` for interactive
- Don't increase letter-spacing on headings — Camera Plain is designed to run tight at scale


### PPT-image Guardrails

- Do preserve the original mood before adding presentation convenience.
- Do generate from the slide thesis, not from the overall deck topic alone.
- Do leave room for editable slide text instead of baking everything into the image.
- Do keep one dominant idea per frame.
- Don't turn every slide into a homepage hero.
- Don't import off-brand gradients, stock photography tropes, or default AI wallpaper aesthetics.
- Don't bake unreadable microtext, fake dashboards, or dense UI chrome into supporting images unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Original UI Responsiveness

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile Small | <600px | Tight single column, reduced padding |
| Mobile | 600–640px | Standard mobile layout |
| Tablet Small | 640–700px | 2-column grids begin |
| Tablet | 700–768px | Card grids expand |
| Desktop Small | 768–1024px | Multi-column layouts |
| Desktop | 1024–1280px | Full feature layout |
| Large Desktop | 1280–1536px | Maximum content width, generous margins |

### Touch Targets
- Buttons: 8px 16px padding (comfortable touch)
- Navigation: adequate spacing between items
- Pill buttons: 9999px radius creates large tap-friendly targets
- Menu toggle: 6px radius button with adequate sizing

### Collapsing Strategy
- Hero: 60px → 48px → 36px headline scaling with proportional letter-spacing
- Navigation: horizontal links → hamburger menu at 768px
- Feature cards: 3-column → 2-column → single column stacked
- Template gallery: grid → stacked vertical cards
- Stats bar: horizontal → stacked vertical
- Footer: multi-column → stacked single column
- Section spacing: 128px+ → 64px on mobile

### Image Behavior
- Template screenshots maintain `1px solid #eceae4` border at all sizes
- 12px border radius preserved across breakpoints
- Gallery images responsive with consistent aspect ratios
- Hero gradient softens/simplifies on mobile


### PPT-image Crop & Export Behavior

- Treat responsiveness as crop resilience, PDF export resilience, and projector readability.
- Generate the master in `16:9`, but keep essential meaning safe under a mild crop to `4:3`.
- Prepare left-safe, right-safe, or center-safe variants when the final slide layout is not locked.
- Avoid placing critical labels, faces, or symbols near the outer 8% margins.
- If a deck will carry heavy overlay copy, request a calmer variant with more negative space.

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Original UI Prompt Reference

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary CTA: Charcoal (`#1c1c1c`)
- Background: Cream (`#f7f4ed`)
- Heading text: Charcoal (`#1c1c1c`)
- Body text: Muted Gray (`#5f5f5d`)
- Border: `#eceae4` (passive), `rgba(28,28,28,0.4)` (interactive)
- Focus: `rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 4px 12px`
- Button text on dark: `#fcfbf8`

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a hero section on cream background (#f7f4ed). Headline at 60px Camera Plain Variable weight 600, line-height 1.10, letter-spacing -1.5px, color #1c1c1c. Subtitle at 18px weight 400, line-height 1.38, color #5f5f5d. Dark CTA button (#1c1c1c bg, #fcfbf8 text, 6px radius, 8px 16px padding, inset shadow) and ghost button (transparent bg, 1px solid rgba(28,28,28,0.4) border, 6px radius)."
- "Design a card on cream (#f7f4ed) background. Border: 1px solid #eceae4. Radius 12px. No box-shadow. Title at 20px Camera Plain Variable weight 400, line-height 1.25, color #1c1c1c. Body at 14px weight 400, color #5f5f5d."
- "Build a template gallery: grid of cards with 12px radius, 1px solid #eceae4 border, cream backgrounds. Each card: image with 12px top radius, title below. Hover: subtle border darkening."
- "Create navigation: sticky on cream (#f7f4ed). Camera Plain 16px weight 400 for links, #1c1c1c text. Dark CTA button right-aligned with inset shadow. Mobile: hamburger menu with 6px radius."
- "Design a stats section: large numbers at 48px Camera Plain weight 600, letter-spacing -1.2px, #1c1c1c. Labels below at 16px weight 400, #5f5f5d. Horizontal layout with 32px gap."

### Iteration Guide
1. Always use cream (`#f7f4ed`) as the base — never pure white
2. Derive grays from `#1c1c1c` at opacity levels rather than using distinct hex values
3. Use `#eceae4` borders for containment, not shadows
4. Letter-spacing scales with size: -1.5px at 60px, -1.2px at 48px, -0.9px at 36px, normal at 16px
5. Two weights: 400 (everything except headings) and 600 (headings)
6. The inset shadow on dark buttons is the signature detail — don't skip it
7. Camera Plain Variable at weight 480 is for special display moments only

Keep the palette anchored in Cream (#f7f4ed), Charcoal (#1c1c1c), and Charcoal (#1c1c1c).
Preserve these signature cues: Warm parchment background (#f7f4ed) — not white, not beige, a deliberate cream that feels hand-selected, Camera Plain Variable typeface with humanist warmth and editorial letter-spacing at display sizes, and Opacity-driven color system: all grays derived from #1c1c1c at varying transparency levels.
Slide thesis: [fill in]. Use one dominant subject, a cinematic but controlled composition, and a clean [left/right/top] title-safe zone. Make the frame feel like the brand at first glance, even before any text is added.
Always leave a clean title-safe zone, keep the image readable in thumbnail view, and avoid generic stock scenes or literal webpage screenshots unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.
