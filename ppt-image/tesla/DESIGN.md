# PPT-image Design System Inspired by Tesla

This file adapts the original web/UI-focused design system into a presentation-image system for slides.
Use it to generate cover art, chapter dividers, concept visuals, comparison plates, system diagrams, data backdrops, and closing posters that still feel unmistakably Tesla.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

This PPT-image adaptation keeps Tesla's brand DNA intact, but compresses it into slide-ready visuals instead of webpage UI.
The first priority is to preserve the original atmosphere: Tesla's website is an exercise in radical subtraction — a digital showroom where the product is everything and the interface is almost nothing.
The second priority is to make every image behave like a presentation asset: one slide thesis, one dominant focal point, and enough calm space for editable overlay text.

### Original Brand DNA

Tesla's website is an exercise in radical subtraction — a digital showroom where the product is everything and the interface is almost nothing. The page opens with a full-viewport hero that fills the entire screen with cinematic car photography: three vehicles arranged on polished concrete against a hazy cityscape sky, with a single model name floating above in translucent white type. There are no decorative borders, no gradients, no patterns, no shadows. The UI exists only to provide just enough navigational structure to get out of the way. Every pixel that isn't product imagery is white space, and that restraint is the design system's most powerful statement.

The color philosophy is almost ascetic: a single blue (`#3E6AE1`) for primary calls to action, three shades of dark gray for text hierarchy, and white for everything else. The entire emotional weight is carried by photography — sprawling landscape shots, studio-lit vehicle profiles, and atmospheric environmental compositions that stretch edge-to-edge across each viewport-height section. The UI chrome dissolves into the imagery. The navigation bar floats above the hero with no visible background, border, or shadow — the TESLA wordmark and five navigation labels simply exist in the space, trusting the content beneath them to provide sufficient contrast.

Typography recently transitioned from Gotham to Universal Sans — a custom family split into "Display" for headlines and "Text" for body/UI elements — unifying the website, mobile app, and in-car software into a single typographic voice. The Display variant renders hero titles at 40px weight 500, while the Text variant handles everything from navigation (14px/500) to body copy (14px/400). The font carries a geometric precision with slightly humanist terminals that feels engineered rather than designed — exactly matching Tesla's brand identity of technology that doesn't need to announce itself. There are no text shadows, no text gradients, no decorative type treatments. Every letterform earns its place through clarity alone.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Full-viewport hero sections (100vh) dominated by cinematic car photography with minimal overlay UI
- Near-zero UI decoration: no shadows, no gradients, no borders, no patterns anywhere on the page
- Single accent color — Electric Blue (`#3E6AE1`) — used exclusively for primary CTA buttons
- Universal Sans font family (Display + Text) unifying web, app, and in-car interfaces
- Photography-first presentation where product imagery carries all emotional weight
- Frosted-glass navigation concept with transparent/white nav that floats over hero content
- 0.33s cubic-bezier transitions as the universal timing for all interactive state changes
- Carousel-driven hero with dot indicators and edge arrow navigation for multiple vehicle showcases
- "Ask a Question" persistent chatbot bar anchored to the viewport bottom


### PPT-image Translation

- Treat every image as a slide asset, not a webpage screenshot.
- Preserve the brand's strongest cues: Full-viewport hero sections (100vh) dominated by cinematic car photography with minimal overlay UI, Near-zero UI decoration: no shadows, no gradients, no borders, no patterns anywhere on the page, Single accent color — Electric Blue (#3E6AE1) — used exclusively for primary CTA buttons, and Universal Sans font family (Display + Text) unifying web, app, and in-car interfaces.
- Use Electric Blue (#3E6AE1) as the highest-signal accent when color needs to carry emphasis.
- Let Pure White (#FFFFFF) carry calmer title-safe zones and quieter data-support slides.
- Use Carbon Dark (#171A20) for cinematic divider slides, closing posters, or contrast-heavy cover moments.
- Keep 25% to 35% of the frame visibly calmer than the hero area so the slide layer can hold live text.
- When in doubt, choose one dominant subject, one support layer, and one background atmosphere layer instead of recreating dense UI layouts.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Original Brand Palette

### Primary
- **Electric Blue** (`#3E6AE1`): Primary CTA button background — a confident, mid-saturation blue (rgb 62, 106, 225) that stands alone as the only chromatic color in the entire interface. Used exclusively for "Order Now" and other primary action buttons
- **Pure White** (`#FFFFFF`): Dominant background color for all surfaces, panels, navigation, and secondary button fills — the canvas that lets photography breathe

### Secondary & Accent
- **Promo Blue** (`#3E6AE1`): Blue also serves for promotional text ("0% APR Available") displayed over hero imagery in the same hue as the CTA — creating a visual link between incentive messaging and action
- No secondary accent colors exist. Tesla deliberately avoids color variety to maintain extreme visual discipline

### Surface & Background
- **White Canvas** (`#FFFFFF`): Page background, navigation panel, dropdown menus, and all surface containers
- **Light Ash** (`#F4F4F4`): Subtle alternate surface for section differentiation — barely perceptible shift from pure white (rgb 244, 244, 244)
- **Carbon Dark** (`#171A20`): Dark surface color for hero text overlays and potential dark-mode contexts (rgb 23, 26, 32) — a warm near-black with a blue undertone
- **Frosted Glass** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75)`): Semi-transparent white for navigation backdrop-filter effects on scroll

### Neutrals & Text
- **Carbon Dark** (`#171A20`): Primary heading and navigation text — the darkest text value (rgb 23, 26, 32), used for model names, nav labels, and hero titles on light backgrounds
- **Graphite** (`#393C41`): Body text and secondary content (rgb 57, 60, 65) — the default paragraph color, slightly warmer than pure gray
- **Pewter** (`#5C5E62`): Tertiary text for sub-links, secondary navigation links like "Learn" and "Order" (rgb 92, 94, 98)
- **Silver Fog** (`#8E8E8E`): Placeholder text in input fields and disabled states (rgb 142, 142, 142)
- **Cloud Gray** (`#EEEEEE`): Light borders and divider lines (rgb 238, 238, 238)
- **Pale Silver** (`#D0D1D2`): Subtle UI borders and delineation (rgb 208, 209, 210)

### Semantic & Accent
- Tesla's marketing site avoids semantic color coding (no green/red/yellow status indicators). Error, success, and warning states follow standard browser defaults in form contexts
- The blue CTA (`#3E6AE1`) serves as the sole interactive color signal

### Gradient System
- No gradients are used anywhere in the interface
- Depth is achieved entirely through photography, whitespace, and the binary contrast between full-bleed imagery and clean white surfaces
- The navigation achieves layering through opacity (frosted glass effect) rather than gradient or shadow


### PPT-image Deployment

- Base canvas: prefer Pure White (#FFFFFF) when the deck needs editorial calm or readable overlay copy.
- Bold contrast canvas: prefer Carbon Dark (#171A20) when the deck needs cinematic weight or a chapter reset.
- Primary accent: Electric Blue (#3E6AE1) should carry the strongest callout, hero focal area, or high-signal data accent.
- Chart and callout rule: stay inside the original palette above; do not import generic presentation blues or purples if they are not already part of the brand.
- Safe-zone rule: overlay areas should be one contrast step quieter than the hero area.
- Series rule: the same accent/surface hierarchy should repeat across cover, divider, body images, and closing slides so the deck reads as one system.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Original Brand Typography

### Font Family
- **Display**: `Universal Sans Display`, -apple-system, Arial, sans-serif — used for hero titles and large model names. A geometric sans-serif with precisely engineered proportions, recently replacing Gotham to unify Tesla's digital ecosystem (website, mobile app, vehicle interface)
- **Text/UI**: `Universal Sans Text`, -apple-system, Arial, sans-serif — used for navigation, body copy, buttons, and all UI text. Optimized for legibility at smaller sizes with slightly wider proportions than the Display variant
- **No OpenType features** detected — typography is completely unembellished
- **No italic variants** observed on the marketing site

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Hero Title | 40px (2.50rem) | 500 | 48px (1.20) | normal | Universal Sans Display, white on dark hero imagery |
| Product Name | 17px (1.06rem) | 500 | 20px (1.18) | normal | Universal Sans Text, model names in nav panel and cards |
| Nav Item | 14px (0.88rem) | 500 | 16.8px (1.20) | normal | Universal Sans Text, primary navigation labels |
| Body Text | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 20px (1.43) | normal | Universal Sans Text, paragraph and descriptive content |
| Button Label | 14px (0.88rem) | 500 | 16.8px (1.20) | normal | Universal Sans Text, CTA button text |
| Sub-link | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 20px (1.43) | normal | Tertiary links (Learn, Order, Experience) |
| Promo Text | 22px (1.38rem) | 400 | 20px (0.91) | normal | White promotional text on hero ("0% APR Available") |
| Category Label | 16px (est.) | 500 | — | normal | White text labels on category cards ("Sport Sedan") |

### Principles
- **"Normal" letter-spacing everywhere**: Unlike most modern tech brands that use negative tracking for headlines, Tesla uses default letter-spacing at every level. This reflects a philosophy that the typeface should speak for itself without manipulation
- **Weight restraint**: Only two weights appear — 500 (medium) for headings/UI and 400 (regular) for body. No bold (700), no light (300). The system avoids typographic drama
- **Unified font sizing**: Most UI text clusters at 14px with only hero titles (40px) and promo text (22px) breaking away. This extreme uniformity creates a sense of engineered consistency
- **Display vs Text split**: The two-variant system (Display for hero, Text for UI) creates subtle optical correction without visible stylistic difference — they appear as the same typeface at different sizes
- **No text transforms**: No uppercase text appears in the main navigation or CTAs — the lowercase approach reinforces Tesla's understated confidence


### PPT-image Type Deployment

- Use `Universal Sans Display, -apple-system, Arial, sans-serif — used for hero titles and large model names. A geometric sans-serif with precisely engineered proportions, recently replacing Gotham to unify Tesla's digital ecosystem (website, mobile app, vehicle interface)` as the reference voice for cover words, chapter titles, or one-line in-image headlines when baked text is necessary.
- Use `Universal Sans Text, -apple-system, Arial, sans-serif — used for navigation, body copy, buttons, and all UI text. Optimized for legibility at smaller sizes with slightly wider proportions than the Display variant` for labels, short annotations, numerals, or tiny UI-like callouts inside the art.
- Do not bake full slide titles, speaker notes, or body paragraphs into generated images.
- Favor one hero word, one short divider title, one oversized number, or 1 to 3 diagram labels that can survive projection.
- Preserve the original brand's weight, tracking, and casing personality instead of flattening everything into generic presentation typography.

## 4. Component Stylings

### Original UI Motifs

### Buttons
All buttons use barely-rounded rectangles (4px border-radius) — creating a sharp, technical aesthetic that mirrors the precision of the vehicles.

**Primary CTA** — The main action button:
- Default: bg `#3E6AE1` (Electric Blue), text `#FFFFFF`, fontSize 14px, fontWeight 500, padding 4px with inner content centering, borderRadius 4px, minHeight 40px, width 200px
- Border: 3px solid transparent (reserves space for focus/active border animation)
- Box Shadow: `rgba(0,0,0,0) 0px 0px 0px 2px inset` (invisible at rest, animates to visible on focus)
- Transition: `border-color 0.33s, background-color 0.33s, color 0.33s, box-shadow 0.25s`
- Hover: subtle darkening of blue background
- Used for: "Order Now" calls to action

**Secondary CTA** — The alternative action button:
- Default: bg `#FFFFFF`, text `#393C41` (Graphite), same dimensions and border pattern as primary
- Transition: identical timing to primary (0.33s)
- Used for: "View Inventory" alongside primary CTA

**Nav Button** — Top navigation items:
- Default: bg transparent, text `#171A20` (Carbon Dark), fontSize 14px, fontWeight 500, borderRadius 4px, padding 4px 16px, minHeight 32px
- Transition: `color 0.33s, background-color 0.33s`
- Active/expanded: subtle background highlight
- Used for: "Vehicles", "Energy", "Charging", "Discover", "Shop"

**Text Link** — In-content actions:
- Default: text `#5C5E62` (Pewter), fontSize 14px, fontWeight 400, no background, no border
- Hover: underline decoration with box-shadow transition
- Transition: `box-shadow 0.33s cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0, 0.75), color 0.33s`
- Used for: "Learn", "Order", "Experience", "New", "Pre-Owned" links in dropdown panel

### Cards & Containers

**Vehicle Card** (Navigation panel):
- Background: transparent (inherits panel white)
- Border: none
- Shadow: none
- Content: vehicle image (transparent PNG) + model name centered below + two text links
- Layout: 3-column grid within the dropdown panel
- No hover animation on the card itself — interaction is via the text links beneath

**Category Card** (Homepage lower section):
- Background: full-bleed landscape photography
- Border radius: approximately 12px (subtly rounded)
- Overflow: hidden (clips image to rounded corners)
- Text: white label in top-left corner ("Sport Sedan", "Midsize SUV")
- Size: large format, approximately 2:1 aspect ratio
- No shadow, no border, no overlay gradient — text relies on image darkness for contrast

### Inputs & Forms
- Background: transparent
- Text color: `#171A20` (Carbon Dark)
- Placeholder color: `#8E8E8E` (Silver Fog)
- Border: minimal, inherits from browser defaults
- Font: Universal Sans Text, 14px
- The "Ask a Question" chatbot input bar sits at the viewport bottom with a clean white background and subtle border

### Navigation
- **Desktop**: Centered horizontal nav with TESLA wordmark (spaced uppercase letters) on the left, five category buttons center-aligned, and three icon buttons (help, globe/language, account) on the right
- **Background**: White (transitions from transparent over dark hero to opaque white on scroll via class toggle `tds-site-header--white-background`)
- **Dropdown panel**: Full-width white panel with 3-column vehicle grid + right sidebar text links, no shadow, no border — appears seamlessly below the nav
- **Sticky behavior**: `sticky-without-slide` class — stays at top without slide-in animation
- **Mobile**: Hamburger collapse pattern
- **No visible separator** between nav and content — the nav blends with the hero

### Image Treatment
- **Hero**: Full-viewport (100vh) sections with cinematic photography — edge-to-edge, no padding, no margin
- **Vehicle images**: Transparent PNG renders on white background in dropdown panel, studio-quality 3/4 angle shots
- **Category cards**: Landscape photography with approximately 2:1 ratio, rounded corners (12px)
- **Carousel**: Auto-advancing with dot indicators (3 dots) and left/right arrow navigation on edges
- **Lazy loading**: Below-fold sections use lazy loading, rendering as blank white until scrolled into view

### Persistent Chat Bar
- Anchored to viewport bottom, visible across all sections
- White background with subtle border
- Contains: chat icon + "Ask a Question" label + placeholder text ("What's Dog Mode?") + send icon + "Schedule a Drive Today" secondary CTA
- Schedule CTA has a teal/blue icon accent


### PPT-image Asset Translation

#### Cover / Opening Hero

- Use Tesla's strongest visual cues as one large, unmistakable scene or object.
- Let Electric Blue (#3E6AE1), Pure White (#FFFFFF), and Carbon Dark (#171A20) establish the hierarchy before adding any text.
- Pull attitude from Buttons, Cards & Containers, Inputs & Forms, and Navigation rather than recreating literal buttons, nav bars, or forms.
- Keep the cover readable in thumbnail view and leave one obvious title-safe zone.

#### Section Divider

- Simplify the composition relative to the cover.
- Keep the brand mood intact, but reduce detail density so the divider feels like a chapter reset rather than a second homepage hero.
- Reuse the same material and depth language instead of inventing a new visual style mid-deck.

#### Concept Visualization

- Translate abstract ideas into one visual metaphor that still feels native to Tesla.
- Borrow the brand's surface language, shape logic, and spacing restraint from the original system above.
- Avoid icon soup, dashboard screenshots, or five competing metaphors in one frame.

#### Comparison Plate

- When the slide is about contrast, use split composition, confrontation, or mirrored structure without abandoning the brand system.
- Let the palette do part of the comparison work: Pure White (#FFFFFF) versus Carbon Dark (#171A20), with Electric Blue (#3E6AE1) reserved for the decisive signal.
- Keep both sides visually disciplined so the comparison reads at a glance.

#### Data Backdrop

- Data-support images should be calmer than cover or divider art.
- Use the brand's layout and spacing DNA (Spacing System, Grid & Container, and Whitespace Philosophy) to create clean fields for charts, numerals, or callouts.
- Avoid hero subjects that fight the actual data layer.

#### System / Workflow Plate

- Convert the original component logic into presentation diagrams, route maps, or structural visuals rather than literal product UI.
- Keep the image designed, not tool-generated: large shapes, few node types, deliberate connectors, and brand-consistent type.
- Depth should follow Shadow Philosophy and Decorative Depth instead of generic infographic shadows.

#### Closing Poster

- Compress the deck's final judgment into one memorable frame.
- Use the same brand surfaces and accent hierarchy, but simplify harder than the cover.
- The closing image should resolve the story, not reopen complexity.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Original Layout DNA

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px
- **Common values**: 8px (0.5rem), 16px (1rem), 21.44px (1.34rem)
- **Button padding**: 4px (minimal outer) with content centering via flexbox, 4px 16px for nav items
- **Section padding**: Full-viewport sections with content centered vertically
- **Card gap**: approximately 16px between category cards

### Grid & Container
- **Max width**: approximately 1383px (full viewport width used for most content)
- **Hero**: Full-bleed, edge-to-edge, 100vh sections
- **Navigation panel**: 3-column grid for vehicle cards with right-aligned text sidebar (~70/30 split)
- **Category cards**: 2-up horizontal layout (large left card + smaller right card)

### Whitespace Philosophy
Tesla uses whitespace as a luxury signal. The generous vertical spacing between sections (each section is a full viewport height) means you can only see one "message" at a time — one car, one model name, one CTA pair. This creates a gallery-like browsing experience where each scroll is a deliberate transition, not a continuous feed. White space is not empty — it's the frame that elevates each vehicle to the status of art piece.

### Border Radius Scale
| Value | Context |
|-------|---------|
| 0px | Most elements — sharp edges are the default |
| 4px | Buttons (primary, secondary, nav items) — barely perceptible rounding |
| ~12px | Category cards — noticeable but restrained rounding on larger surfaces |
| 50% | Carousel dot indicators — perfect circles |


### PPT-image Layout Translation

- Default output: `16:9` horizontal, ideally `3840x2160`.
- Keep meaning-critical content inside the central 80% width and height so mild crop or projector overscan does not break the slide.
- Translate the brand's spacing philosophy above into image composition rather than scroll rhythm.
- Reuse the original radius/edge discipline inside objects, cards, frames, or image masks.
- Let asymmetry create cleaner title-safe zones when possible; use symmetry only when the concept itself is ceremonial, confrontational, or product-showroom centered.

## 6. Depth & Elevation

### Original Depth System

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Level 0 (Flat) | No shadow, no border | Default state for all elements — cards, panels, buttons at rest |
| Level 1 (Frost) | `rgba(255,255,255,0.75)` backdrop | Navigation bar on scroll — frosted glass transparency |
| Level 2 (Overlay) | `rgba(128,128,128,0.65)` | Modal overlays and region/cookie popups |
| Level 3 (Subtle) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.05)` | Minimal shadow hints on rare hover states |

### Shadow Philosophy
Tesla's approach to elevation is essentially "none." The site avoids box-shadows entirely in its primary interface. Depth is communicated through three alternative strategies:
1. **Z-index layering**: The sticky navigation sits above hero content through positioning, not shadow
2. **Opacity-based transparency**: The frosted glass nav and overlay modals use background-color opacity rather than shadow to indicate layering
3. **Photography-as-depth**: The full-bleed images create their own visual depth through perspective, lighting, and composition — making UI shadows redundant

### Decorative Depth
- No gradients, glows, or atmospheric effects on UI elements
- The hero imagery itself provides all visual richness — sunset skies, reflected light on car surfaces, ground shadows from studio lighting
- The carousel arrow buttons use a semi-transparent white background to float above the hero imagery without disrupting it


### PPT-image Depth Translation

- Use the same elevation language above in image form: hero subject, support plane, background atmosphere.
- Preserve the brand's native depth behavior instead of defaulting to generic 3D gloss or floating glass panels.
- If the original system is flat, keep slide art flatter and more graphic.
- If the original system uses rings, glow, or border-defined depth, let those cues appear in the image edges, frames, and callout objects.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Original Guardrails

### Do
- Let photography dominate every screen — the product IS the design
- Use Electric Blue (`#3E6AE1`) exclusively for primary CTAs — never for decorative purposes
- Maintain viewport-height sections for major content blocks — one message per screen
- Keep typography at weight 400-500 only — no bold, no light, no extremes
- Use 4px border-radius for all interactive elements — precision over playfulness
- Trust whitespace as a luxury signal — never fill available space just because it's empty
- Keep all transitions at 0.33s — consistency in motion is as important as consistency in color
- Use transparent PNG vehicle imagery on white backgrounds for product showcases
- Center CTAs horizontally below model names — the vertical rhythm is model → subtitle → buttons
- Maintain the Display/Text font split — Display for hero-scale text only, Text for everything else

### Don't
- Add shadows to any element — elevation through shadow contradicts the flat, gallery aesthetic
- Use more than one chromatic color besides the blue CTA — the palette is intentionally monochrome-plus-one
- Apply gradients, patterns, or decorative backgrounds to surfaces — white and photography are the only backgrounds
- Use text larger than 40px on the web — the typography is deliberately restrained even at hero scale
- Add borders to cards or containers — separation is achieved through spacing, not lines
- Use uppercase text transforms — Tesla's confidence is expressed through lowercase calm
- Introduce rounded-pill buttons or large border-radii — the 4px radius is deliberate and precise
- Override the Universal Sans family with other typefaces — cross-platform consistency is a core brand value
- Add hover animations with scale/translate transforms — Tesla's interactions are color-only (background and border transitions)
- Clutter the viewport with multiple CTAs — every screen should have at most two action buttons


### PPT-image Guardrails

- Do preserve the original mood before adding presentation convenience.
- Do generate from the slide thesis, not from the overall deck topic alone.
- Do leave room for editable slide text instead of baking everything into the image.
- Do keep one dominant idea per frame.
- Don't turn every slide into a homepage hero.
- Don't import off-brand gradients, stock photography tropes, or default AI wallpaper aesthetics.
- Don't bake unreadable microtext, fake dashboards, or dense UI chrome into supporting images unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Original UI Responsiveness

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <768px | Single-column layout, hamburger nav replaces horizontal labels, hero text scales to ~28px, CTA buttons stack vertically, category cards become full-width |
| Tablet | 768-1024px | 2-column nav panel, hero maintains full-viewport height, CTAs remain side-by-side, reduced horizontal padding |
| Desktop | 1024-1440px | Full horizontal nav, 3-column vehicle grid in dropdown, hero at 40px, side-by-side CTAs at 200px/160px width |
| Large Desktop | >1440px | Content remains centered, hero photography scales to fill wider viewports, max-width container for nav panel content |

### Touch Targets
- Primary CTA buttons: 200px × 40px minimum (well above 44×44px WCAG requirement)
- Nav buttons: minimum 32px height with 4px 16px padding — adequate touch targets
- Carousel arrows: ~44px square white semi-transparent buttons at viewport edges
- Text links ("Learn", "Order"): 14px text with adequate line-height spacing for touch

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Horizontal category buttons (Vehicles, Energy, Charging, Discover, Shop) collapse to a hamburger/drawer menu on mobile
- **Hero CTA pair**: Side-by-side buttons on desktop stack vertically on mobile
- **Category cards**: 2-up horizontal layout collapses to single-column full-width on mobile
- **Vehicle grid**: 3-column grid in desktop nav panel becomes 2-column on tablet, single-column on mobile
- **Spacing**: Section vertical padding remains generous (viewport-height sections) but horizontal padding reduces

### Image Behavior
- Hero images are fully responsive and fill the entire viewport at every breakpoint
- Vehicle carousel images use `object-fit: cover` to maintain cinematic composition across widths
- Transparent PNG vehicle images in the nav panel scale proportionally within their grid cells
- Category card images maintain their landscape ratio and clip via `overflow: hidden` with border-radius


### PPT-image Crop & Export Behavior

- Treat responsiveness as crop resilience, PDF export resilience, and projector readability.
- Generate the master in `16:9`, but keep essential meaning safe under a mild crop to `4:3`.
- Prepare left-safe, right-safe, or center-safe variants when the final slide layout is not locked.
- Avoid placing critical labels, faces, or symbols near the outer 8% margins.
- If a deck will carry heavy overlay copy, request a calmer variant with more negative space.

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Original UI Prompt Reference

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary CTA: "Electric Blue (#3E6AE1)"
- Background: "Pure White (#FFFFFF)"
- Heading text: "Carbon Dark (#171A20)"
- Body text: "Graphite (#393C41)"
- Tertiary text: "Pewter (#5C5E62)"
- Placeholder: "Silver Fog (#8E8E8E)"
- Alternate surface: "Light Ash (#F4F4F4)"
- Dark surface: "Carbon Dark (#171A20)"

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a hero section with a full-viewport background image, centered 'Model Y' title in Universal Sans Display at 40px weight 500 in white, a subtitle line below, and two buttons side by side: a primary Electric Blue (#3E6AE1) 'Order Now' button and a secondary white 'View Inventory' button, both with 4px border-radius and 40px height"
- "Design a navigation bar with a spaced-letter wordmark on the left, five text buttons (14px, weight 500, Carbon Dark #171A20) centered, and three icon buttons on the right, all on a white background with no shadow or border"
- "Build a vehicle card grid with 3 columns, each card showing a transparent-background car image above a model name (17px, weight 500, Carbon Dark) and two text links (14px, weight 400, Pewter #5C5E62) labeled 'Learn' and 'Order', on a pure white surface with no borders or shadows"
- "Create a category card with full-bleed landscape photography, 12px border-radius, overflow hidden, and a white text label ('Sport Sedan') positioned in the top-left corner with no overlay gradient"
- "Design a persistent bottom bar with a chat input ('Ask a Question' placeholder), a send icon, and a secondary CTA ('Schedule a Drive Today') with a teal icon, anchored to the viewport bottom on a white background"

### Iteration Guide
When refining existing screens generated with this design system:
1. Focus on ONE component at a time — Tesla's system is so minimal that each element must be pixel-perfect
2. Reference specific color names and hex codes from this document — there are only 6-7 colors in the entire system
3. Use natural language descriptions, not CSS values — "barely rounded corners" not "border-radius: 4px"
4. Describe the desired "feel" alongside specific measurements — "gallery-like silence between sections" communicates the whitespace philosophy better than "margin-bottom: 100vh"
5. Always verify that photography is doing the emotional heavy-lifting — if the UI itself feels "designed," it's too much

Use Universal Sans Display, -apple-system, Arial, sans-serif — used for hero titles and large model names. A geometric sans-serif with precisely engineered proportions, recently replacing Gotham to unify Tesla's digital ecosystem (website, mobile app, vehicle interface) as the display-type reference and Universal Sans Text, -apple-system, Arial, sans-serif — used for navigation, body copy, buttons, and all UI text. Optimized for legibility at smaller sizes with slightly wider proportions than the Display variant for any short in-image labels.
Keep the palette anchored in Pure White (#FFFFFF), Carbon Dark (#171A20), and Electric Blue (#3E6AE1).
Preserve these signature cues: Full-viewport hero sections (100vh) dominated by cinematic car photography with minimal overlay UI, Near-zero UI decoration: no shadows, no gradients, no borders, no patterns anywhere on the page, and Single accent color — Electric Blue (#3E6AE1) — used exclusively for primary CTA buttons.
Slide thesis: [fill in]. Use one dominant subject, a cinematic but controlled composition, and a clean [left/right/top] title-safe zone. Make the frame feel like the brand at first glance, even before any text is added.
Always leave a clean title-safe zone, keep the image readable in thumbnail view, and avoid generic stock scenes or literal webpage screenshots unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.

Chapter theme: [fill in]. Reduce detail density compared with the cover, keep more negative space, and make the image feel like a chapter reset rather than a second homepage hero.
Always leave a clean title-safe zone, keep the image readable in thumbnail view, and avoid generic stock scenes or literal webpage screenshots unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.

Slide thesis: [fill in]. Translate the abstract idea into one clear visual metaphor that still belongs to the brand system. Do not create an infographic or icon collage.
Always leave a clean title-safe zone, keep the image readable in thumbnail view, and avoid generic stock scenes or literal webpage screenshots unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.

This image supports a chart or big number slide. Keep it calmer than a cover image, leave generous negative space, and let surfaces/structure support the data instead of overpowering it.
Always leave a clean title-safe zone, keep the image readable in thumbnail view, and avoid generic stock scenes or literal webpage screenshots unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.
