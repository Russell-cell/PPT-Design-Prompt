# PPT-image Design System Inspired by Apple

This file adapts the original web/UI-focused design system into a presentation-image system for slides.
Use it to generate cover art, chapter dividers, concept visuals, comparison plates, system diagrams, data backdrops, and closing posters that still feel unmistakably Apple.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

This PPT-image adaptation keeps Apple's brand DNA intact, but compresses it into slide-ready visuals instead of webpage UI.
The first priority is to preserve the original atmosphere: Apple's website is a masterclass in controlled drama — vast expanses of pure black and near-white serve as cinematic backdrops for products that are photographed as if they were sculptures in a gallery.
The second priority is to make every image behave like a presentation asset: one slide thesis, one dominant focal point, and enough calm space for editable overlay text.

### Original Brand DNA

Apple's website is a masterclass in controlled drama — vast expanses of pure black and near-white serve as cinematic backdrops for products that are photographed as if they were sculptures in a gallery. The design philosophy is reductive to its core: every pixel exists in service of the product, and the interface itself retreats until it becomes invisible. This is not minimalism as aesthetic preference; it is minimalism as reverence for the object.

The typography anchors everything. San Francisco (SF Pro Display for large sizes, SF Pro Text for body) is Apple's proprietary typeface, engineered with optical sizing that automatically adjusts letterforms depending on point size. At display sizes (56px), weight 600 with a tight line-height of 1.07 and subtle negative letter-spacing (-0.28px) creates headlines that feel machined rather than typeset — precise, confident, and unapologetically direct. At body sizes (17px), the tracking loosens slightly (-0.374px) and line-height opens to 1.47, creating a reading rhythm that is comfortable without ever feeling slack.

The color story is starkly binary. Product sections alternate between pure black (`#000000`) backgrounds with white text and light gray (`#f5f5f7`) backgrounds with near-black text (`#1d1d1f`). This creates a cinematic pacing — dark sections feel immersive and premium, light sections feel open and informational. The only chromatic accent is Apple Blue (`#0071e3`), reserved exclusively for interactive elements: links, buttons, and focus states. This singular accent color in a sea of neutrals gives every clickable element unmistakable visibility.

**Key Characteristics:**
- SF Pro Display/Text with optical sizing — letterforms adapt automatically to size context
- Binary light/dark section rhythm: black (`#000000`) alternating with light gray (`#f5f5f7`)
- Single accent color: Apple Blue (`#0071e3`) reserved exclusively for interactive elements
- Product-as-hero photography on solid color fields — no gradients, no textures, no distractions
- Extremely tight headline line-heights (1.07-1.14) creating compressed, billboard-like impact
- Full-width section layout with centered content — the viewport IS the canvas
- Pill-shaped CTAs (980px radius) creating soft, approachable action buttons
- Generous whitespace between sections allowing each product moment to breathe


### PPT-image Translation

- Treat every image as a slide asset, not a webpage screenshot.
- Preserve the brand's strongest cues: SF Pro Display/Text with optical sizing — letterforms adapt automatically to size context, Binary light/dark section rhythm: black (#000000) alternating with light gray (#f5f5f7), Single accent color: Apple Blue (#0071e3) reserved exclusively for interactive elements, and Product-as-hero photography on solid color fields — no gradients, no textures, no distractions.
- Use Apple Blue (#0071e3) as the highest-signal accent when color needs to carry emphasis.
- Let Light Gray (#f5f5f7) carry calmer title-safe zones and quieter data-support slides.
- Use Near Black (#1d1d1f) for cinematic divider slides, closing posters, or contrast-heavy cover moments.
- Keep 25% to 35% of the frame visibly calmer than the hero area so the slide layer can hold live text.
- When in doubt, choose one dominant subject, one support layer, and one background atmosphere layer instead of recreating dense UI layouts.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Original Brand Palette

### Primary
- **Pure Black** (`#000000`): Hero section backgrounds, immersive product showcases. The darkest canvas for the brightest products.
- **Light Gray** (`#f5f5f7`): Alternate section backgrounds, informational areas. Not white — the slight blue-gray tint prevents sterility.
- **Near Black** (`#1d1d1f`): Primary text on light backgrounds, dark button fills. Slightly warmer than pure black for comfortable reading.

### Interactive
- **Apple Blue** (`#0071e3`): `--sk-focus-color`, primary CTA backgrounds, focus rings. The ONLY chromatic color in the interface.
- **Link Blue** (`#0066cc`): `--sk-body-link-color`, inline text links. Slightly darker than Apple Blue for text-level readability.
- **Bright Blue** (`#2997ff`): Links on dark backgrounds. Higher luminance for contrast on black sections.

### Text
- **White** (`#ffffff`): Text on dark backgrounds, button text on blue/dark CTAs.
- **Near Black** (`#1d1d1f`): Primary body text on light backgrounds.
- **Black 80%** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`): Secondary text, nav items on light backgrounds. Slightly softened.
- **Black 48%** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.48)`): Tertiary text, disabled states, carousel controls.

### Surface & Dark Variants
- **Dark Surface 1** (`#272729`): Card backgrounds in dark sections.
- **Dark Surface 2** (`#262628`): Subtle surface variation in dark contexts.
- **Dark Surface 3** (`#28282a`): Elevated cards on dark backgrounds.
- **Dark Surface 4** (`#2a2a2d`): Highest dark surface elevation.
- **Dark Surface 5** (`#242426`): Deepest dark surface tone.

### Button States
- **Button Active** (`#ededf2`): Active/pressed state for light buttons.
- **Button Default Light** (`#fafafc`): Search/filter button backgrounds.
- **Overlay** (`rgba(210, 210, 215, 0.64)`): Media control scrims, overlays.
- **White 32%** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.32)`): Hover state on dark modal close buttons.

### Shadows
- **Card Shadow** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22) 3px 5px 30px 0px`): Soft, diffused elevation for product cards. Offset and wide blur create a natural, photographic shadow.


### PPT-image Deployment

- Base canvas: prefer Light Gray (#f5f5f7) when the deck needs editorial calm or readable overlay copy.
- Bold contrast canvas: prefer Near Black (#1d1d1f) when the deck needs cinematic weight or a chapter reset.
- Primary accent: Apple Blue (#0071e3) should carry the strongest callout, hero focal area, or high-signal data accent.
- Chart and callout rule: stay inside the original palette above; do not import generic presentation blues or purples if they are not already part of the brand.
- Safe-zone rule: overlay areas should be one contrast step quieter than the hero area.
- Series rule: the same accent/surface hierarchy should repeat across cover, divider, body images, and closing slides so the deck reads as one system.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Original Brand Typography

### Font Family
- **Display**: `SF Pro Display`, with fallbacks: `SF Pro Icons, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Body**: `SF Pro Text`, with fallbacks: `SF Pro Icons, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- SF Pro Display is used at 20px and above; SF Pro Text is optimized for 19px and below.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display Hero | SF Pro Display | 56px (3.50rem) | 600 | 1.07 (tight) | -0.28px | Product launch headlines, maximum impact |
| Section Heading | SF Pro Display | 40px (2.50rem) | 600 | 1.10 (tight) | normal | Feature section titles |
| Tile Heading | SF Pro Display | 28px (1.75rem) | 400 | 1.14 (tight) | 0.196px | Product tile headlines |
| Card Title | SF Pro Display | 21px (1.31rem) | 700 | 1.19 (tight) | 0.231px | Bold card headings |
| Sub-heading | SF Pro Display | 21px (1.31rem) | 400 | 1.19 (tight) | 0.231px | Regular card headings |
| Nav Heading | SF Pro Text | 34px (2.13rem) | 600 | 1.47 | -0.374px | Large navigation headings |
| Sub-nav | SF Pro Text | 24px (1.50rem) | 300 | 1.50 | normal | Light sub-navigation text |
| Body | SF Pro Text | 17px (1.06rem) | 400 | 1.47 | -0.374px | Standard reading text |
| Body Emphasis | SF Pro Text | 17px (1.06rem) | 600 | 1.24 (tight) | -0.374px | Emphasized body text, labels |
| Button Large | SF Pro Text | 18px (1.13rem) | 300 | 1.00 (tight) | normal | Large button text, light weight |
| Button | SF Pro Text | 17px (1.06rem) | 400 | 2.41 (relaxed) | normal | Standard button text |
| Link | SF Pro Text | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 1.43 | -0.224px | Body links, "Learn more" |
| Caption | SF Pro Text | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 1.29 (tight) | -0.224px | Secondary text, descriptions |
| Caption Bold | SF Pro Text | 14px (0.88rem) | 600 | 1.29 (tight) | -0.224px | Emphasized captions |
| Micro | SF Pro Text | 12px (0.75rem) | 400 | 1.33 | -0.12px | Fine print, footnotes |
| Micro Bold | SF Pro Text | 12px (0.75rem) | 600 | 1.33 | -0.12px | Bold fine print |
| Nano | SF Pro Text | 10px (0.63rem) | 400 | 1.47 | -0.08px | Legal text, smallest size |

### Principles
- **Optical sizing as philosophy**: SF Pro automatically switches between Display and Text optical sizes. Display versions have wider letter spacing and thinner strokes optimized for large sizes; Text versions are tighter and sturdier for small sizes. This means the font literally changes its DNA based on context.
- **Weight restraint**: The scale spans 300 (light) to 700 (bold) but most text lives at 400 (regular) and 600 (semibold). Weight 300 appears only on large decorative text. Weight 700 is rare, used only for bold card titles.
- **Negative tracking at all sizes**: Unlike most systems that only track headlines, Apple applies subtle negative letter-spacing even at body sizes (-0.374px at 17px, -0.224px at 14px, -0.12px at 12px). This creates universally tight, efficient text.
- **Extreme line-height range**: Headlines compress to 1.07 while body text opens to 1.47, and some button contexts stretch to 2.41. This dramatic range creates clear visual hierarchy through rhythm alone.


### PPT-image Type Deployment

- Use `SF Pro Display, with fallbacks: SF Pro Icons, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` as the reference voice for cover words, chapter titles, or one-line in-image headlines when baked text is necessary.
- Use `SF Pro Text, with fallbacks: SF Pro Icons, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` for labels, short annotations, numerals, or tiny UI-like callouts inside the art.
- Do not bake full slide titles, speaker notes, or body paragraphs into generated images.
- Favor one hero word, one short divider title, one oversized number, or 1 to 3 diagram labels that can survive projection.
- Preserve the original brand's weight, tracking, and casing personality instead of flattening everything into generic presentation typography.

- Border: none (borders are rare in Apple's system)
- Radius: 5px-8px
- Shadow: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22) 3px 5px 30px 0px` for elevated product cards
- Content: centered, generous padding

- Active: underline on hover
- Logo: Apple logomark (SVG) centered or left-aligned, 17x48px viewport
- Mobile: collapses to hamburger with full-screen overlay menu
- The nav floats above content, maintaining its dark translucent glass regardless of section background

### Image Treatment
- Products on solid-color fields (black or white) — no backgrounds, no context, just the object
- Full-bleed section images that span the entire viewport width
- Product photography at extremely high resolution with subtle shadows
- Lifestyle images confined to rounded-corner containers (12px+ radius)

### Distinctive Components

**Product Hero Module**

- Product image dominating 60-70% of the tile
- Product name + one-line description below
- "Learn more" and "Shop" link pair at bottom

**Feature Comparison Strip**
- Horizontal scroll of product variants
- Each variant as a vertical card with image, name, and key specs
- Minimal chrome — the products speak for themselves


### PPT-image Asset Translation

#### Cover / Opening Hero

- Use Apple's strongest visual cues as one large, unmistakable scene or object.
- Let Apple Blue (#0071e3), Light Gray (#f5f5f7), and Near Black (#1d1d1f) establish the hierarchy before adding any text.
- Pull attitude from Buttons, Cards & Containers, Navigation, and Image Treatment rather than recreating literal buttons, nav bars, or forms.
- Keep the cover readable in thumbnail view and leave one obvious title-safe zone.

#### Section Divider

- Simplify the composition relative to the cover.
- Keep the brand mood intact, but reduce detail density so the divider feels like a chapter reset rather than a second homepage hero.
- Reuse the same material and depth language instead of inventing a new visual style mid-deck.

#### Concept Visualization

- Translate abstract ideas into one visual metaphor that still feels native to Apple.
- Borrow the brand's surface language, shape logic, and spacing restraint from the original system above.
- Avoid icon soup, dashboard screenshots, or five competing metaphors in one frame.

#### Comparison Plate

- When the slide is about contrast, use split composition, confrontation, or mirrored structure without abandoning the brand system.
- Let the palette do part of the comparison work: Light Gray (#f5f5f7) versus Near Black (#1d1d1f), with Apple Blue (#0071e3) reserved for the decisive signal.
- Keep both sides visually disciplined so the comparison reads at a glance.

#### Data Backdrop

- Data-support images should be calmer than cover or divider art.
- Use the brand's layout and spacing DNA (Spacing System, Grid & Container, and Whitespace Philosophy) to create clean fields for charts, numerals, or callouts.
- Avoid hero subjects that fight the actual data layer.

#### System / Workflow Plate

- Convert the original component logic into presentation diagrams, route maps, or structural visuals rather than literal product UI.
- Keep the image designed, not tool-generated: large shapes, few node types, deliberate connectors, and brand-consistent type.
- Depth should follow Decorative Depth instead of generic infographic shadows.

#### Closing Poster

- Compress the deck's final judgment into one memorable frame.
- Use the same brand surfaces and accent hierarchy, but simplify harder than the cover.
- The closing image should resolve the story, not reopen complexity.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Original Layout DNA

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 2px, 4px, 5px, 6px, 7px, 8px, 9px, 10px, 11px, 14px, 15px, 17px, 20px, 24px
- Notable characteristic: the scale is dense at small sizes (2-11px) with granular 1px increments, then jumps in larger steps. This allows precise micro-adjustments for typography and icon alignment.

### Grid & Container
- Max content width: approximately 980px (the recurring "980px radius" in pill buttons echoes this width)
- Hero: full-viewport-width sections with centered content block
- Product grids: 2-3 column layouts within centered container
- Single-column for hero moments — one product, one message, full attention
- No visible grid lines or gutters — spacing creates implied structure

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Cinematic breathing room**: Each product section occupies a full viewport height (or close to it). The whitespace between products is not empty — it is the pause between scenes in a film.
- **Vertical rhythm through color blocks**: Rather than using spacing alone to separate sections, Apple uses alternating background colors (black, `#f5f5f7`, white). Each color change signals a new "scene."
- **Compression within, expansion between**: Text blocks are tightly set (negative letter-spacing, tight line-heights) while the space surrounding them is vast. This creates a tension between density and openness.

### Border Radius Scale
- Micro (5px): Small containers, link tags
- Standard (8px): Buttons, product cards, image containers
- Comfortable (11px): Search inputs, filter buttons
- Large (12px): Feature panels, lifestyle image containers
- Full Pill (980px): CTA links ("Learn more", "Shop"), navigation pills
- Circle (50%): Media controls (play/pause, arrows)


### PPT-image Layout Translation

- Default output: `16:9` horizontal, ideally `3840x2160`.
- Keep meaning-critical content inside the central 80% width and height so mild crop or projector overscan does not break the slide.
- Translate the brand's spacing philosophy above into image composition rather than scroll rhythm.
- Reuse the original radius/edge discipline inside objects, cards, frames, or image masks.
- Let asymmetry create cleaner title-safe zones when possible; use symmetry only when the concept itself is ceremonial, confrontational, or product-showroom centered.

## 6. Depth & Elevation

### Original Depth System

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, solid background | Standard content sections, text blocks |
| Navigation Glass | `backdrop-filter: saturate(180%) blur(20px)` on `rgba(0,0,0,0.8)` | Sticky navigation bar — the glass effect |
| Subtle Lift (Level 1) | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22) 3px 5px 30px 0px` | Product cards, floating elements |
| Media Control | `rgba(210, 210, 215, 0.64)` background with scale transforms | Play/pause buttons, carousel controls |
| Focus (Accessibility) | `2px solid #0071e3` outline | Keyboard focus on all interactive elements |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Apple uses shadow extremely sparingly. The primary shadow (`3px 5px 30px` with 0.22 opacity) is soft, wide, and offset — mimicking a diffused studio light casting a natural shadow beneath a physical object. This reinforces the "product as physical sculpture" metaphor. Most elements have NO shadow at all; elevation comes from background color contrast (dark card on darker background, or light card on slightly different gray).

### Decorative Depth
- Navigation glass: the translucent, blurred navigation bar is the most recognizable depth element, creating a sense of floating UI above scrolling content
- Section color transitions: depth is implied by the alternation between black and light gray sections rather than by shadows
- Product photography shadows: the products themselves cast shadows in their photography, so the UI doesn't need to add synthetic ones


### PPT-image Depth Translation

- Use the same elevation language above in image form: hero subject, support plane, background atmosphere.
- Preserve the brand's native depth behavior instead of defaulting to generic 3D gloss or floating glass panels.
- If the original system is flat, keep slide art flatter and more graphic.
- If the original system uses rings, glow, or border-defined depth, let those cues appear in the image edges, frames, and callout objects.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Original Guardrails

### Do
- Use SF Pro Display at 20px+ and SF Pro Text below 20px — respect the optical sizing boundary
- Apply negative letter-spacing at all text sizes (not just headlines) — Apple tracks tight universally
- Use Apple Blue (`#0071e3`) ONLY for interactive elements — it must be the singular accent
- Alternate between black and light gray (`#f5f5f7`) section backgrounds for cinematic rhythm
- Use 980px pill radius for CTA links — the signature Apple link shape
- Keep product imagery on solid-color fields with no competing visual elements
- Use the translucent dark glass (`rgba(0,0,0,0.8)` + blur) for sticky navigation
- Compress headline line-heights to 1.07-1.14 — Apple headlines are famously tight

### Don't
- Don't introduce additional accent colors — the entire chromatic budget is spent on blue
- Don't use heavy shadows or multiple shadow layers — Apple's shadow system is one soft diffused shadow or nothing
- Don't use borders on cards or containers — Apple almost never uses visible borders (except on specific buttons)
- Don't apply wide letter-spacing to SF Pro — it is designed to run tight at every size
- Don't use weight 800 or 900 — the maximum is 700 (bold), and even that is rare
- Don't add textures, patterns, or gradients to backgrounds — solid colors only
- Don't make the navigation opaque — the glass blur effect is essential to the Apple UI identity
- Don't center-align body text — Apple body copy is left-aligned; only headlines center
- Don't use rounded corners larger than 12px on rectangular elements (980px is for pills only)


### PPT-image Guardrails

- Do preserve the original mood before adding presentation convenience.
- Do generate from the slide thesis, not from the overall deck topic alone.
- Do leave room for editable slide text instead of baking everything into the image.
- Do keep one dominant idea per frame.
- Don't turn every slide into a homepage hero.
- Don't import off-brand gradients, stock photography tropes, or default AI wallpaper aesthetics.
- Don't bake unreadable microtext, fake dashboards, or dense UI chrome into supporting images unless the slide explicitly needs product UI.

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Original UI Responsiveness

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Small Mobile | <360px | Minimum supported, single column |
| Mobile | 360-480px | Standard mobile layout |
| Mobile Large | 480-640px | Wider single column, larger images |
| Tablet Small | 640-834px | 2-column product grids begin |
| Tablet | 834-1024px | Full tablet layout, expanded nav |
| Desktop Small | 1024-1070px | Standard desktop layout begins |
| Desktop | 1070-1440px | Full layout, max content width |
| Large Desktop | >1440px | Centered with generous margins |

### Touch Targets
- Primary CTAs: 8px 15px padding creating ~44px touch height
- Navigation links: 48px height with adequate spacing
- Media controls: 50% radius circular buttons, minimum 44x44px
- "Learn more" pills: generous padding for comfortable tapping

### Collapsing Strategy
- Hero headlines: 56px Display → 40px → 28px on mobile, maintaining tight line-height proportionally
- Product grids: 3-column → 2-column → single column stacked
- Navigation: full horizontal nav → compact mobile menu (hamburger)
- Product hero modules: full-bleed maintained at all sizes, text scales down
- Section backgrounds: maintain full-width color blocks at all breakpoints — the cinematic rhythm never breaks
- Image sizing: products scale proportionally, never crop — the product silhouette is sacred

### Image Behavior
- Product photography maintains aspect ratio at all breakpoints
- Hero product images scale down but stay centered
- Full-bleed section backgrounds persist at every size
- Lifestyle images may crop on mobile but maintain their rounded corners
- Lazy loading for below-fold product images


### PPT-image Crop & Export Behavior

- Treat responsiveness as crop resilience, PDF export resilience, and projector readability.
- Generate the master in `16:9`, but keep essential meaning safe under a mild crop to `4:3`.
- Prepare left-safe, right-safe, or center-safe variants when the final slide layout is not locked.
- Avoid placing critical labels, faces, or symbols near the outer 8% margins.
- If a deck will carry heavy overlay copy, request a calmer variant with more negative space.

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Original UI Prompt Reference

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary CTA: Apple Blue (`#0071e3`)
- Page background (light): `#f5f5f7`

### Iteration Guide
1. Every interactive element gets Apple Blue (`#0071e3`) — no other accent colors
2. Section backgrounds alternate: black for immersive moments, `#f5f5f7` for informational moments
3. Typography optical sizing: SF Pro Display at 20px+, SF Pro Text below — never mix
4. Negative letter-spacing at all sizes: -0.28px at 56px, -0.374px at 17px, -0.224px at 14px, -0.12px at 12px
5. The navigation glass effect (translucent dark + blur) is non-negotiable — it defines the Apple web experience
6. Products always appear on solid color fields — never on gradients, textures, or lifestyle backgrounds in hero modules
7. Shadow is rare and always soft: `3px 5px 30px 0.22 opacity` or nothing at all
8. Pill CTAs use 980px radius — this creates the signature Apple rounded-rectangle-that-looks-like-a-capsule shape
